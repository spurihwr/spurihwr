- 👋 Hi, I’m Saurabh Puri. 
- 👀 I’m interested in the signal processing domain particularly video and image processing, video compression, video streaming, AI, machine learning, AR/VR technologies etc. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning deep learning and computer vision. I am also curious to learn more on game engines so that I can work on applications involving 3D graphics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cool idea around videos and multimedia. 
- 📫 You can reach me on my personal email spurihwr@gmail.com
